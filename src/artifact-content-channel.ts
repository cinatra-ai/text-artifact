// THE VERSIONED SERVER CONTENT CHANNEL, as this display reads it.
//
// The content a display draws arrives ON ITS PROPS, read from the pinned
// revision on the server and capped there: a display switches on `kind`, never
// infers a class from a mime, and never reaches for bytes from the browser.
// `none` is a first-class answer carrying a NAMED reason, which is why this
// display can always say what it is showing, or why it is not.
//
// THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS THE SDK LEAF `@cinatra-ai/sdk-extensions/artifact-content-channel`.
// This module is a LOCAL STRUCTURAL COPY of that leaf's TYPES, declared here —
// and not imported — for the same single reason the props copy beside it gives:
// the SDK is not resolvable from a standalone extension repository, so importing
// it would break this package's own install and typecheck. It copies types, one
// integer and two frozen enumerations ONLY: no cap arithmetic, no predicate, no
// behaviour. Replace it with a type-only import from the leaf as soon as the SDK
// resolves from a standalone repository.
