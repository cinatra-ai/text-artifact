// THE DECISION LEAF every slot of this package shares: it maps the authorized
// host snapshot to exactly one of two outcomes, and it is the only place in this
// package that reads the content channel.
//
//   `text` — the pinned text the host projected, with what the channel said
//     about it (the revision it was read from, and whether the host cut it to
//     its cap).
//   `floor` — a NAMED reason it cannot be drawn. Never blank, never a throw: a
//     display that threw would take the surface around it down with it.
//
// TOTAL: every input returns a view, including an input that is not a snapshot
// at all. Nothing here reaches the network, and nothing downstream of it does
// either — the whole point of the channel is that the content is already here.
