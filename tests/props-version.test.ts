// @vitest-environment node
// THE PROPS VERSION IS ONE NUMBER, DECLARED IN THREE PLACES, and they may never
// drift: the module constant the display checks a snapshot against, the
// `propsApiVersion` each renderer entry declares in the authoritative manifest,
// and the typed mirror this package exports.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. The host resolves a display, reads the
// version it declares, and builds the snapshot AT THAT VERSION. A manifest that
// declares one version while the display checks another does not fail loudly —
// it floors every reader, on every surface, with a snapshot the host built
// exactly as asked.
