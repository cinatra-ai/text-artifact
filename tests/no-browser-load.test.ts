// @vitest-environment node
// THE DISPLAY REACHES THE NETWORK BY NO ROAD AT ALL.
//
// The content channel exists because a display that reaches for its own bytes
// from the browser paints nothing inside a third-party application: the address
// is there, but the credential that would authorize it is not. Moving the
// content onto the props is only half of that; the other half is that no road
// back to the network survives anywhere in the shipped source.
//
// SO THIS SCANS THE SHIPPED SOURCE ITSELF rather than one render. A spy over one
// mounted component proves nothing about the branch that was not taken, and a
// subresource address on an element — a frame, a picture, a stylesheet — is a
// load the browser performs without any call this package makes. Both die here.
//
// WHAT THIS SCAN IS, HONESTLY. It is a mechanical guard over the source this
// package publishes, not a proof of absence: a determined author can always
// reach a global through a computed name this cannot see. It is sized for the
// failure it exists to catch — a road added back by ordinary means, by someone
// who did not know it had been removed on purpose — and the suite below asserts
// the guard is LIVE, by proving every pattern fires on a probe rather than
// trusting an empty offender list to mean anything.
//
// COMMENTS ARE REMOVED AS SPANS, not as whole lines: prose ABOUT the rule must
// never read as the rule being broken, and code that happens to share a line
// with a comment must never be dropped out of the scan along with it.
